          How does it work? You, the teacher, purchase the subscription for a
          low monthly fee and get access to the entire Flangoo library for
          yourself and up to 180 of your students. Students get unique passcodes
          and individual access to read the books. You choose the books or make
          it your online FVR library and let your students choose what they
          read. Think of it like our version of NetflixÂ® for readers!
