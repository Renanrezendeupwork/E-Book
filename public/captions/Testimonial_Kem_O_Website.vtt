Hello. My name is Kem Opperman-Torres,

00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:07.100
and I teach fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth Spanish.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.100
What I love, is there's a library at my fingertips,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.475
but more than that, there is a library at my student's fingertips.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.975
I'm excited that there are questions, and I am excited that there is an answer key.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.900
One of the features I'm very excited, and I hope that you all will use more

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:23.000
is the underlines under the words where they can hover-over and read them.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.625
The reading feature is fantastic!

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.850
It helps them so much, and sometimes, the reading with the different voices... they love that.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.925
The love that they can know when the characters are changing.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.500
The price is so phenomenal!

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:42.750
You just can't get access to that many readers, for than many students, at that price.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.025
So, thank you very much for this program.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.800
I was thrilled when it said it was coming out,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.300
and it has definitely worked fabulous at my school, and changed the way

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.300
that I'm using reading and readers in my class.
