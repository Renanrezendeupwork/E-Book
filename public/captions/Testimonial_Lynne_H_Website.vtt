Hi, my name is Lynne Hendrick.

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:07.200
I am a German teacher at the secondary level. I teach German levels 1 through 5,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:13.200
and I have enjoyed using Flangoo this year because it's given my students

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.975
an opportunity to read independently; something of their choice.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.350
It's a reliable, dependable website. It doesn't fail on us. It's not difficult to navigate,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.875
and the students really seem to like all of the features, the read aloud, the colorful nature if it. All of that.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.900
I like that I can see what the kids have been reading, and how long they've been reading,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.025
and I really like that I don't have to troubleshoot every ten minutes.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.875
So, I highly recommend Flangoo. I can't wait to see how much more they add in.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.875
There's so much more that they could put in, so it will be exciting to see how it develops in the future.

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.325
Auf Wiedersehen. Chuse. Danke schön Flangoo.
