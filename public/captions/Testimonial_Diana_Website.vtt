Hi, My name is Diana Moss,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.475
and I teach Spanish at the Harker School in southern California,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.300
and my Spanish 1 students really enjoyed reading <i>Pobretica Ana</i>

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.850
because it coincided with a lesson we were doing with clothing and shopping,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.100
so they got to read about about the markets of Guatemala,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.325
while we were learning about clothing, and then doing skits.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.400
And then my Spanish 4 students were reading <i>Frida Soy complicada,</i>

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.150
and those students were doing a project, a research project about hispanic artists,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.200
so we read about Frida, and we learned all about her from Flangoo,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.025
and it kind of helped make that unit come alive.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.550
So, reading is a great way, obviously, to grow student's vocabulary.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.850
Students did little short writing paragraphs following the reading,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.175
which really showed me that they really were understanding what they were doing.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.150
So, thanks.
