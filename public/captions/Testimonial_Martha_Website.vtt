Hola amigos. My name is Martha,

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.370
and I teach at Excelsior Classes,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.650
an online academy for homeschoolers.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.450
Because we meet virtually,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.620
the idea of a class library was out of reach

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.150
for my students, and for me.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.500
I really struggled trying to find material

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.120
that was cost-effective,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
relevant, and accessible to my students.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.770
Flangoo has turned out to be the solution to this problem.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.420
I love the variety of reading materials,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.220
the audio component, the comprehension questions,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.200
and the teacher controls that allow me to

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.650
gauge student participation and performance,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650
but I'm not the only one who loves it.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.320
My students love it too.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.120
The subject matter, the comprehensible input,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.320
the glossary, all these are elements

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.920
that they have commented on.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.670
The teacher controls also reveal that many of my students

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.670
are going beyond the required reading,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.020
and have been sneaking extra reading.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.670
It's very easy and intuitive for the students

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.670
to both register and navigate,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.370
and the how-to videos are very clear and informative,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.870
and there's a little bit of personality in them as well.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.020
My students really loved Brody in his instructional video.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.100
Flangoo is a fabulous service.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.370
I highly recommend it,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.450
and I'm planning to make it a regular language

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.220
acquisition tool in my beginning and intermediate

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.200
language courses.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.370
Give it a try.
