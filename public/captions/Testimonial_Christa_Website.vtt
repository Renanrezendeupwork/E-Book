My name's Christy Schubert, and I teach both French and Spanish

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.250
at Hamady Middle School in Bay City.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.375
Completely worth the subscription price in my opinion.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:14.325
I love that all the readers are leveled.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.500
I love that I can keep a library of certain things I want to work on,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.800
and I love that I can give them, my students, only those things that I want them to work on at a time.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:29.850
So, that is a huge bonus.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.400
I love the audio feature on that, and I love that the readers have an authentic accent.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.975
I really felt that the e-readers were a perfect fit.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.375
My students just happened to need that reading comprehension work in particular,

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:55.200
and that really fit the bill, so I just decided to take the plunge and pay for this one.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.800
Thank you so much. I appreciate that this is all out there for us as resources.
