I am using the novel <i>Rescate en la montaña</i>, Level 2, with my heritage speakers.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.725
They are in grades three through five, and their level is pretty good.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.500
So we are reading that and talking about that novel.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.150
Now, they've had Spanish since kindergarten, but you know, obviously, it's still Spanish 1.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.150
Last year, I did... the last two years, I read with them in class aloud.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.000
That's the kind of book I'm looking for.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.350
Something that... with a content and the level is appropriate for nine and ten-year-olds.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.450
So far, I've been very happy with the first book that we are reading

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.100
which is <i>Rescate en la montaña</i>, with my heritage speakers.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.350
Thanks so much. Bye.
