Hi. I'm Bess Klander,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.200
and I teach Spanish 1 and 3 right now at high school in Virginia.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.570
I got Flangoo this year because I have been using novels in class,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.620
CI novels in class for a couple years now,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.870
and with the virus,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.020
and the back-and-forth nature of hybrid, and in person,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.300
and on-line, and all the stuff,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.800
I decided that it would be a lot better to have something that the kids could access here,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
at school, and at home, and, you know...wherever.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.800
So, it's been really good in that aspect for me,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.470
and for the kids, they're always able to access it.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.620
Customer service has been really, really great about getting us back on track.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.570
I don't have any complaints about Flangoo. I've really enjoyed having been adding more, and more titles

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.420
since I signed up in the fall.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.970
The kids seem to like it.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.020
I love it.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.470
I guess that's all I've got to say.
