Hi there.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.800
I teach in Brevard, North Carolina,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.375
and I just picked up a Flangoo subscription,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.525
I guess in the winter of the year, last year,

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:13.220
as an extra resource for my sixth, seventh, and eight graders.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.750
I teach exploratory Spanish, and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.650
I have formally taught "Lorena", the story of Lorena in the level one readers,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950
to my eight graders. They really liked that.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.700
I love the cultural books especially.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.050
Anything having to do with authentic holidays, or authentic culture,

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:36.325
I think is really interesting for my students,

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:41.825
and, of course, I believe that reading is so important for them.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.550
I'm really happy that you came out with this program.

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:48.875
I think it's going to keep on getting better and better,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.750
and I look forward to seeing what y'all do with it next.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.700
So thank you very much for providing your resource,

00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:00.375
and thanks for the workshop too. It was a lot of fun, and

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.370
have a great day.
