Hey there, Angie from Iowa here.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.400
Thought I'd give my little review on Flangoo.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.920
Let me tell you that this a really great product

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:13.175
that came at an awesome time in my opinion, and...

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:16.575
You think about it, you have so many students that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
are gone from your class

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.850
for whatever reasons. Maybe, maybe they have school events.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.075
We like our kids to be active and well-rounded.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.450
Maybe they, you know, they've been gone for whatever other absence.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.225
This is a really powerful tool that you can put in your kids hands.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.225
They already have their devices with them.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:39.325
They take them with them everywhere they go,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.875
even when they are gone, and, you don't have to worry about

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:48.700
sending a book with them, and worrying about not getting it back.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.900
You can just say, "Hey, hop on Flangoo. Read this particular book."

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900
They can flip through it wherever they are,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.475
and I think that's really awesome.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:02.300
So, you know, kudos to Teacher's Discovery.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.000
Thank you for a really awesome product that is continuing to be fantastic,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.350
and what you can see on the screen here as well is kind of the landing space,

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.200
and, they have it divided into a few different levels,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.325
and there's lots and lots of books on here.

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:25.150
You've got your chapter book readers, but you've also got these

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.475
Alsop little mini, mini-stories, mini-dramas.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.700
I have actually used this one in my class before,

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:43.550
and so what you can do when you get into one of these, you can click start reading,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.150
and I'll show you, once navigation goes,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.200
but also, we what that accessibility. We want that equality of education for our kids.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.125
This is embedded. Love this.

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:01.900
They can listen to it. They can slow it down. They can speed it up.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.525
You've got lots of different words here that are italicized.

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:10.150
So, a small, small little bite sized story in this case,

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.150
Let's say you need to look up a few things, OK,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.375
Look down here. You've got the glossary, so if you want to look up a word,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.600
that's how you do it.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:21.325
You want to hop back-and-forth between chapters?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.300
that's how you do it.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.050
So, again, like I said, it's a really powerful resource.

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:29.320
You can see here that there're chapter questions as well.

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:35.000
So, again, try this out. It's really, it's really worth it.
