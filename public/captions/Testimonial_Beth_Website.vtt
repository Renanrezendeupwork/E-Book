Hello. My name is Beth Duda, and I teach Spanish, levels 2, 3, and 4,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.925
and last year, at the end of the school year, I was looking through the Teacher's Discovery catalog,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.650
and I came across the Flangoo advertisement,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.275
and I thought that this would be a very good program for my students,

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:23.975
because it offered so many different stories, and the levels that they offer

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.325
that I can use among all my kids because of their different skill levels in Spanish.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:37.550
Not only will it help them increase in their vocabulary, their reading skills, how Spanish, the language itself works,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.400
but also to read questions, and also write to questions in Spanish,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.975
because all  of these skills are important in order to be somewhat fluent in a world language.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.125
I can assign books to the class, I can have kids who are higher in the skill levels with Spanish,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:03.450
they can choose a book that they wish to read. They can all work at their level.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.525
I like how the program offers the speaking portion so they can hear how the words are pronounced,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.650
and watch as the reader is reading it in Spanish, and if they want, they can go back

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.100
and re-read it themselves without that tool. All of these tools that you have offered with this program

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.775
are very good for the student, because all students are different.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.175
There are stories about situations that maybe, that they themselves are having here at school, or at home,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.350
and without them really realizing it, we're talking about the issue.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.975
I can't wait till our classes begin some more today, so I can assign them a reading portion, and some questions.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.350
I appreciate the this program, and I wish you all well. Thank you. Bye, bye.
